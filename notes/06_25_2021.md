### To do:
- Figure out Minimal Viable Product version
- Break project down into subprojects:
  - Webapp w/ Python? 
    - Upload Audio file and spit out bytes of file.

### Thoughts:


### Meeting notes:
I met with Gaz briefly to go over next steps after getting the dev environment set up for spitting out a model with the training program. We realized that the models themselves were available online (whoops!) so next steps are to try to create a model on my local machine. If that hits a bump, I'll move ahead with using the available models. 

What are Augmentations:
- for example if analyzing images, add images w/blurriness, non-centered image, to expand training data set. 
- lr = learning rate - how fast you want your machine to learn. Too fast/too slow can be problematic. 


Take code from [already built models](https://www.kaggle.com/taggatle/cornell-birdcall-identification-1st-place-solution/output) and run again dataset. 
- take in single input and give single prediction.s
