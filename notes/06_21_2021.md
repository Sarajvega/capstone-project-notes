### To do:
- Figure out Minimal Viable Product version
- Break project down into subprojects:
  - Webapp w/ Python? 
    - Upload Audio file and spit out bytes of file.

### Thoughts:
I deleted my repo and started over to see if I could get a different error than the one I got on Friday.
When I run: `python sed_train.py --config "config_params.example_config"`
I get: `No module named 'torchvision'`. Gaz suggested to solve this by running `pip install numba==0.48`, which caused me to run into an issue with the llvmlite version?
```
Installing collected packages: llvmlite, numba
  Attempting uninstall: llvmlite
    Found existing installation: llvmlite 0.36.0
    Uninstalling llvmlite-0.36.0:
      Successfully uninstalled llvmlite-0.36.0
    Running setup.py install for llvmlite ... error
```

I struggled to find the correct version of llvmlite for `numba==0.48`.


I found this (Stack overflow)[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60244383/how-can-i-create-a-virtual-environment-with-virtualenv-for-python-3-7-without-ha]

`pip install --user pipenv` gave an error. Locking failed. Issues with compatible versions? 

### Meeting notes:
No meeting! Just trying to figure out this issue.
