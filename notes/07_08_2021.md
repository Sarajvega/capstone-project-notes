### Thoughts:
All in! I started training a model on Lobe with just a couple of plants. What a delightful experience! I really adore the ease of use for this application. 

Gas sent me this [flask setup](https://github.com/lobe/flask-server) for Lobe. I ran into a little hiccup setting things up.

```
$ python -m pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt

```
There's an issue with using a newer version of python for that repo. Tensorflow only supports 64 bit version of [Python](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48720833/could-not-find-a-version-that-satisfies-the-requirement-tensorflow), which is version 3.5 - 3.8. 

To get around I did:
```
pyenv shell 3.7.10 (you may need to do pyenv install 3.7.10 first)
python --version (verify that this prints python 3.7)
python -m venv .venv (create a virtual environment in the .venv folder)
source .venv/bin/activate (activate that environment - your shell should have a (.venv) prefix now)
```
