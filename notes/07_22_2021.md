How should I call two separate APIs?

Prediction service - Keep as a local API using Lobe Connect?
Time: 3 days
- Flask w/Tensor Flow
  - Model built w/dataset of plants
    - What plants?
- IF ONLY LOCAL - Lobe Connect

Caresheet service - Custom API 
Time: 3 days
- Flask
- Create an ERD Diagram/Wireframe
- Connected to separate db
  - What are the columns?
  - Will this be firebase?

Front-end service - calls both prediction and caresheet. 
Time: 
- Refresh new page w/caresheet info
- Determine look
  - Webpage
  - Tablet
  - Mobile (PWA)
- How do enable webcam access
- Call prediction service
  - Take a photo and base to API

Database - Firebase
Time: 
- Is this only for plant care sheet info?

Deployment - Microsoft Azure
Time: 
- Can I deploy everythign as once or does it need to be separate back-end/front-end
